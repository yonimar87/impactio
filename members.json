The world faces great challenges for wildlife conservation , and I have had the opportunity to work on many of them. We must protect not only the endangered animals but also all their habitats and all the ecosystems that they inhabit . I see my role as an advisor and facilitator to the many different countries and organisations working to ensure these challenges for the wildlife are addressed . In this capacity I have written a book entitled Wildlife on a Fast Track: Reducing the Impact. It is aimed at helping countries develop a conservation strategy which will lead to a sustainable future."
